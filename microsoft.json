All the interviewers worked at Microsoft for at least 10 years and were unenthusiastic about their job. The way they talked about their job and presented themselves seems like their career only revolves around Microsoft and they have no plan to go somewhere else. They probably figured their career is stagnant and staying at Microsoft is the safest option. All interviewers didn't ask me about why Microsoft probably because they don't value a candidate's excitement to work at Microsoft. Instead, they asked why I chose computer science as a major. Overall experience was negative because interviewers weren't excited about their job. The reason interviewers worked there was because they needed a job. Even my recruiter didn't seem happy.

Final question about 9 marbles, 1 heavier than all of them, find it using a 2 plate scale.Get an email inviting me to fly out a month later. They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day\u2026\u00a0 of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly.Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure.But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them.Technical questions were:-Implement circular array with a k-step elimination-Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum-Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix-Without knowing the size of an array, find an element.Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized.The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part.Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable.",

Phone interview consisted of fairly basic data structure questions involving stacks/queues and things like bucket sort. I was surprised by how tailored to my resume all of the other questions were, though. So make sure that you know everything you put on your resume well enough to speak strongly about. I made this mistake but\u2026\u00a0 it was apparently minor enough since I got invited for onsite interviews.Flew out to Seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. We stayed in the commons and hung out with a large (>40) group of other applicants for various positions--mostly SDE intern. It was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. The waiting room for all the interns was very nice. Large touchscreen TV for fruit ninja, another large surface table for other minigames, catered snacks and drinks.I was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. The Microsoft lunch area is very nice. We got a $10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. Everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way. Drinks were also free for all employees, which is cool.I was interviewing for a position in MSIT, which is Microsoft's internal tooling software teams. Things like the enterprise e-commerce division and others. Three technical interviews which were equal parts conversational and coding and one completely conversational job fit. Again my resume topics were discussed quite a bit more than I expected.\u00a0My interviewers were very interested in projects that I had worked on in groups and broad design choices we had made, so if you have any, be ready to speak to them.The interviews went well enough, though I think I choked in the last technical interview. They gradually make your solutions more and more difficult by adding restrictions like runtime and allowed data structures. It got to a point where I simply didn't have an answer, but that might be what they're looking for.2 business days later, I got a call with an offer from my recruiter for an SDE position. A slightly lower base salary from the average, but I suspect they're including at least part of the -very- generous benefits package that Microsoft provides.",

        "details": "I went through the college recruiting process. Microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where I signed up. The first round was on campus: lasted about 40 minutes, and was easy for a computer science major. About a week later, a recruiter emailed me to tell me that I was being invited for on-site interviews in Redmond (Seattle), WA. The recruiters\u2026\u00a0 are extremely fast and helpful in communicating; interestingly, Microsoft's recruiting process outdoes other companies (Google, FB etc) completely in efficiency and generosity. You're flown out to Redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget.Now, it's good to know how on-site interviews work: you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter, who you should befriend since they are \"on your side\", so to speak, and their input can matter in the decision process. Then, you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. You don't have to do perfectly in all of them, but I had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. The first one is particularly important. If you are doing well, you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. If you're lucky, you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes, like in my case, a really impressive big boss type person. This big boss can basically hire you on the spot, and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this.Don't forget that for Microsoft, as well as other companies, several things matter for college recruiting; your interviews, first and foremost, but also your coursework, projects, grades, internship experiences, etc. Also, knowing more math than average CS majors helps.The next day I found out that I was getting an offer, and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. Microsoft really, really wants smart new grads. The company and culture has REALLY been improving the past few years, and they want smart new grads to keep that up. Offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies.In my case, you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end, in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. In this case, you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general \"hired\" pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.",

There were many other candidates, but they were mainly for internships.You meet with your designated recruiter who is your point of contact post-interview. As mentioned in other reviews, talk nicely with this recruiter and highlight your skill and more importantly your passion for Microsoft. This recruiter has a say in your final yes or no decision.Had 5 interviews on-site with 5 senior engineers/managers. Each interviewers experience at Microsoft progresivelly increased- ranging from 10 years to 25 years. Each interview is for 1 hour, in which the interviewer will talk about his role/experience for 10-15 minutes, ask about your experience for 10-15 minutes and the rest would be a coding question.These interviews were not exceptionally difficult. I felt and had heard that more than cracking every coding questions, at Microsoft, it is more about 1. Being very passionate and excited to join Microsoft 2. Writing clean quality code with comments, main driver function, corner cases, talking as you write and testing the code 3. Presenting yourself professionally.You have the write background if you ve made it on-site. Focus on that background, while continually showing your excitment about being there and wanting to join Microsoft. Have a solid answer to \"Why Microsoft?\" Ask them smart questions which show your thinking ability. Before starting to code on whiteboard, ask clarifying questions about the problem, talk about your design to the problem, point out any limitations. Start coding with proper comments, spaces, use good variable/functions names etc.You will hear back from the recruiter in 1-3 days.

I thought it was just a really nice way of saying \"thanks, but no thanks.\"Fast forward to Fall 2015, when my recruiter emailed me and asked me if I would like to go to Redmond\u2026\u00a0 for interviews since the on campus interview went well last year. I went, and I must say that I was very impressed with Microsoft. They drove us potential University Recruits to their campus in a Limo!The interview process was four 45-minute interviews in a row, with a 15 minute break between each one. I was surprised that I was being interviewed for a group that did higher level programming even though I have studied more low-level programming in recent years because I'm a Computer Engineering student. I think some of the other interviewees who were looking for higher level jobs were confused too, because they interviewed most of them for the operating systems track. I'm not sure if there was a mix-up or not!The interviews themselves were very engaging and the interviewers presented challenging questions. I strongly suspect that one of the people who was interviewing me was texting while I had my back turned and was talking through a problem on the whiteboard, but the rest of it went pretty well. I didn't get an offer, but I'm glad I went.",

How many rounds will the interview be.2. How much commission will be cut from your salary (yes commission is taken from the employee's salary on a monthly basis)3.

I had a total of four interviews, one of which was over lunch (the food at their cafeterias is excellent, by the way). All were a lot of fun, and my interviewers chose good questions - ones that could be looked at in many ways, answered in many ways, and expanded on. This made our discussions very interesting. I was extremely tired by the fourth interview, as I had only just arrived at my hotel at midnight the previous night. I got back to the hotel at around 3, and took a nap. My flight didn't leave till close to midnight, so it was a long night getting home...But worth it - I received an offer a week later.Be sure you know your sorting and search algorithms and are knowledgeable about the various properties associated with strings, as well as (non)linear data structures.

        "details": "I am a mechanical engineer by training with past programming experience for primarily personal projects (video games and such) in multiple languages. I'm currently in a PhD program finishing up the masters portion. I casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there \"may\" be something for me at Microsoft but he doesn't know what. He\u2026\u00a0 told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. They called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after.I'm not - what I like to call - \"classically trained\" when it comes to computer science. I prepared for the screening interview by going through the MIT OCW Algorithms and Data Structures course and also reading Miller and Ranum's \"Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures.\" The screening interview went better than expected. Among other things, I was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes.A few weeks later I got a call for a final round interview. It took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so I requested a later date. The scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. They flew me to Redmond for an interview with the Bing team (I wasn't given that information until the morning of the interview). I was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. My first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. Everything after that went smoothly. I got through all 5 interviews. The third interview was over lunch (we wrote code after, not during). The fifth interview was with a program manager. The questions seemed relatively easy. The topics were: queue design, common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure, mixed uni and multi byte character strings, detection of unique addresses, and linked list scanning and element removal. Some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as I could. Others were looking for a discussion of the problem (one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas).At the very end I asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition I was facing. It's nice to be told that there is a \"high probability\" of them making an offer :)",

The interview day was long, I had a series of interviews each testing different areas.All of the interviews were with senior engineers with 5 - 20 years experience.The first interview covered SQL, I was given a schema and asked to point out any issues/improvements and then write some queries.The next 2 covered CS based questions like algorithms, runtime analysis .. etc.Next I had a lunch interview where I was able to talk with another engineer about his role and get a little more of a sense of the day to day life.Finally I had one more algorithms based interview and that was the end.Overall I found that the interview process was very well done and the hr staff at Microsoft were really easy to deal with.

When looking for full time, I contacted the person for any openings in their team. Fortunately, I heard back from them and got a phone screen schedule within one week.Phone Screen was easy and mainly focused on the projects i wrote in my resume and some algorithmic problems\u2026\u00a0 related with those projects.Within one week, I heard back from them that I was through first round and need to come to Seattle for face to face interview. They were really helpful in scheduling the interview according to my convenience.Microsoft takes care of their their employees and potential employees as well in my case. Wonderful and systematic scheduling. I landed in Seattle.Whole day was set aside for interviews, I had 5 in total including the famous 5th interview which is a positive sign as mentioned by many here. First interview, little variation on the level order traversal which i was able to code it with some help from the recruiter who was really nice. You will have to write the code on board so I would suggest do some \"Actual\" coding preferably on some IDE which shows only syntactical errors and runs the program. Eclipse is sometimes too helpful which let's us forget minor mistakes.Second round was a real life project problem related with quick ip lookup, for which I have default solution, Tries. I told each and every pros and cons of using tries and the interviewer was satisfied. I stumbled a little while implementing it but eventually was able to do that with of course the help of interviewer.Oh yeah one more thing each interview is approximately 45 mins to 60 mins long and lunch time discussion is also part of the recruiting process. So don't lose your head thinking that it's not part of the process.3rd interview which included the lunch discussion as i mentioned above. I was not aware of it but since interviewer only discussed my projects on resume, i was happy to talk about them. But was really thinking why the lunch is so much work. Later i realised when interviewer said, let's go back to the office and continue the discussion. This was the toughest round as interviewer went in to very specific details about my projects so one tip do remember some of the tools names, just to name drop them ;)4th round was a short one as the 3rd one went for one and half hours. This one was comparatively lighter and mainly focused on design problems.Then came, the nerve wrecking wait as they told me to wait so that they all can discuss how i performed and decide on the last interview with the 2nd line manager. Thankfully manager came soon and ask me to wait for 2nd line manager. That discussion was very informal sort as he was selling me Microsoft and why I should come and work there. Happy sign always ! :)Then I came back to my awesome hotel as I had my flight back same day in the evening.Almost next day itself the HR contacted me and I missed her call. I really thought I did'nt get through but thankfully Hr called me back next day and told me I am through !!Only advice I can give you is \"CODE\" ! there is no way around it! If you want to work as SDE you need to know Algorithms and Data Structures ! Language is no issue but you must know how to implement it. At least able to discuss why to us and why not to use a particular data structure.",

Both were really pleasant, the engineering interview was a simple programming task done on a laptop: write a function which given a string will return if it contains correctly matched open and closed parentheses. Expanded to include other types of\u2026\u00a0 brackets and return if all were correctly matched.I heard back very quickly informing me I had made it through to the final round on site assessment day. Couldn't make the first couple of interview dates offered so was eventually invited to travel to Redmond for an interview day at the main offices. Organizing travel was very easy and everyone involved was incredibly helpful.On the day, arrived at building 111 for mid morning. Was guided around campus and taken to the commons for a free lunch. We visited the visitors center and the company store and were invited to buy up to $120 of discount merch.We then returned to 111 for the interviews. We were each allocated a division we'd be interviewing for (this was not shared before the first interview). We were each interviewed by four interviewers who asked a variety of question covering fundamentals of computer science and some advanced material. We had a ten minute gap between each interview in which the examiners compared notes before we were launched into the next one.Asked technical questions on a number of topics, sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities, binary trees and binary search trees, low level computer scheduling and atomicity of operations, and an abstract data type question. I've provided examples of a small number of questions below.These were mixed in among other behavioral questions, attitudes, what do you do for fun, what's important when implementing software, how to interact with team members etc.It was generally very broad with lots of interesting questions; I wouldn't say especially hard but thats all relative... If you know the field and are well prepared you shouldn't find anything too tough...Don't worry about making mistakes, I know I sure made a couple, the key is checking back over your solutions as you go, work with test cases and when you identify a shortcoming, work out how you can fix it. TALK OUT LOUD! They don't care if you get stuck in a circle as long as they can see your thought process and why it's happening. If you've overlooked something they will happily drop a hint and see if you can rectify.My biggest tip would be friendly and relaxed, make it more of a conversation than a rigid interview. I almost got the feeling they were more interested in my personality than what I wrote on the board, so make it easy for them to like you: At the end of the day the big question they're asking themselves is, 'would I like to work alongside this person', not just 'can he do the work'.Overall, my interview was incredibly positive, everyone was super friendly and did their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The company was very generous with arranging travel, accommodation etc and first and foremost Microsoft seemed an incredible place to work. Go for it, give it your best shot, what is there to lose?",

        "details": "The communication started through career fair. When I gave my Resume to one of their representative (current Engineer at Microsoft), he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. Later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. I had to raise my eyebrow here, cause the guy has my Resume\u2026\u00a0 and he asked me several questions. This alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. Reading other posts, it seems MS conducts onsite campus interviews, then why forward to recruiter. Perhaps, due to lower reputation of my university, they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite.A couple of weeks later, I got an email to schedule a phone interview. At last, something is better than nothing as I get about half an hour to prove my capacity. I have gone through interview posts here on Glassdoor and I could not find any details on phone interviews. Most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. In any case, I prepared myself with the questions posted and later on I realized those were overkill for the phone interview.Now, I have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. In most cases, I have made it to later rounds in phone interview, but no onsite though. Well, I just want to say I have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews, both technically and behaviorally.The interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. This was already done when I submitted my Resume, so I see no point in reiterating all this. Although, I was asked similar questions in my past interviews, but on those occasions, I did not forward my Resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when I spoke to someone inside the company.Next I was asked several semi-technical and behavioral questions. Most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere, therefore I will not emphasize much on those. However, I will mention some of them below, cause I think it's on these questions I may have under performed. As for other questions, I am sure \"Design a Table\", \"Test an Elevator\" and \"Determining Apple, Orange and Apple-Orange from incorrectly labelled boxes\" should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet.Few days later, I got the usual no offer email. The only positive thing I can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. From what I know, they usually give a 1 year clause, therefore this was a good rejection, I hope.I did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection. I will discuss them in Question sections below. Perhaps you guys could judge if this is certainly worth getting a rejection.",

How would you test the accuracy of data displayed in the website?\"\"You have billions of strings sorted in an array. You don't have any access to it. You just have a method that returns the string pertaining to a index. Use only that method to find the location of a given string\" I started out at 0(n^2) and kept on improving to o(logn)After that, they gave me the results very next day. That was pretty nice of them.",

The second interviewer was late by about 15 mins while I was waiting in the lobby.\u2026\u00a0 The person invited me to his room and started the interview. The question was not clear at all and the person just turned her back on me and started typing an email on her desktop. I thought she was giving me some time to think but when I had a solution, I tried to let her know by calling out her name. She did not acknowledge! Can you believe it??? I was literally standing behind her for 10 minutes telling her that I have a solution. She did not like my solution so moved onto the next question. While I had different solutions, she had something in mind (Note: She was still typing on her computer faced against me)\u00a0At last, when I asked what was the solution to the second question, she was like 'Thats too many lines of code. I cannot explain'.\u00a0The rudest interview of my life. After that, it pretty much set the mood for me for the rest of the day.

Each interviewer generally started by asking me about myself, asked a coding question, asked me to optimize my solution, asked how I should test my solution, then gave me some time to ask them any questions I had. This took about 45 minutes total per interview. Then they would take me to the kitchen to offer me another drink then pass me off onto the next interviewer. One interviewer in the middle took me to lunch, where we ordered our food and took it to his office to eat during the interview. I think there were 5 interviews total, all with members of the same team. Then I took a shuttle back to the first building, where the recruiter from that morning did a debriefing and sent me on my way.They were all very nice throughout the process, and when I asked them questions, they were very honest in their responses, telling me both the pros and cons of working at Microsoft.

They say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager, then you'd get a job. NOPE. NEVER. I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I\u2026\u00a0 got rejected.Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews:1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems.2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string.3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction.4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer...5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years. Very cool, very smart and very fun, It could be easily observed by the flags/decoration in the room/some wine on the table in his room!!! By the way, I didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. So this time, he just started chatting with me which I guess was the behavioral part of the interview. Talking about everything except work, about big corporations, hacking!! and so on. It was truly an amazing experience with that person.Based on the book, I surely have gotten the job, but ....One week later, I got rejected.",

        "details": "Initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. Approximately two weeks later I was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on-campus interview (i.e., first round).The campus interview was with someone who wasn't a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. This interview lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. We mostly talked about items on my resume, whether or not I faced any unique challenges and if\u2026\u00a0 so, how I overcame them. This was a very conventional interview. Upon the conclusion, I was asked a technical question.About three weeks later, I was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if I was available to fly out to Redmond, WA for the second round interview. I had a very compact window to interview within, and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints.On interview day, the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on-site, who will discuss the group / team you will be interviewing with, and answer any other questions you may have at the time. This recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results, and work further with you should you get an offer. After meeting the recruiter, you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. Mine were all in the same building. Next you meet with 3-5 interviewers, and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. You are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one, presumably so they can confirm / deny a weakness.For me, the first interviewer didn't want to talk about my resume at all. He was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. Some non-technical questions were: \"What would you change about Windows?\", \"What do you read to stay on top of the latest technology?\", \"What are some examples of trending applications?\". Then he went to the coding problems. One a mathematical proof, and the second more coding oriented.The next interview was over lunch, and this interviewer asked me initially about my research, but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. After lunch we went back to his office and I was asked another coding problem.The third interview was more theoretical. The interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting, and then we went into an open-ended math / optimization problem.After the third interview, I was told that I would not be seeing the fourth interviewer (this means you failed), and I was taken back to HR to discuss the day with the recruiter. I should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit.Overall, the interview was very challenging. You absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. The second round is not about what you have done, but rather what you can do now, in a high-pressure situation. Also, you are told that you can code in any language, but in reality, you need to be able to code in C/C#. Not being familiar with either, I tried to use Python so as to not get bogged down in syntax, but it was generally not well received.",
